# 1.Why must we choose you?

I am an introvert but I still try to socialise with people because I finished in 1 year of college most of the classes were online when I reached college I tried to make new friends and make connections. Then I understand making a lot of connections doesn't make a difference in your life but making a good connection with people who have similar mindsets and vision can. Because my goal is to build products and become an entrepreneur. By joining Amfoss I can meet like-minded people and make good connections who are more skilled and experienced than me so I can learn and improve myself and my coding skill. I like to contribute and build projects and work with a team. when working with a team, definitely there is going to be a deadline so I and become more disciplined than now and I can learn time management and become more determined about my goals. The main reason I join the club is to build discipline and skill because my goal is to become an entrepreneur I want to build an unwavering level of discipline and do tasks by 'not considering my mood'. finishing things must be by priority. working for a club is not that easy because every task the club gives you is not easy and interesting but I still do the task with discipline.

# 2.What is your plan for the next 6 months?
   
   
I finished my 1st year so I concentrate more on my skill and want to improve my skill in programming so I can build projects. I build a project in java and I built a shopping cart website using Node.js I gain little knowledge about web-dev then I like to study ML and I like to study app development also so I can find which programming field is most suitable for me. I like to do hacker rank and coding competitions.

# 3.How would you contribute back to the club?

I like to contribute to other people who need guidance.

# 4.Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

the process is really good because by doing these tasks everyone can learn "how to learn ". everything is temporary so you just want to learn to do it. Doing things which you know is not a matter, doing things that you don't know and you still manage to do by learning fastly is want matters.
