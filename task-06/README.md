# flutterproj

Building a game in flutter is cool but installing flutter and android studio and setup these was a little difficult for me, installing in ubuntu was very difficult for me so I installed it in my windows and it's working fine than in ubuntu also I completed the installing process. I  tried a lot of times to build the project then I got a reference project that was almost like this one so I took reference for my project also. It helped a lot.
