# THE BOT

creating a bot is cool. I am excited to create a telebot. This is a really easy one because I don't want to build from scratch. most of the code was given and I just want to connect with telegram and OMDB and take requests from the user then collect movie data from OMDB  then write the movie name into a CSV file and message the user. the step by step instruction TODO in the task really helps give the idea of what to do step by step. From this task, I understand the importance of planning the project before doing it because if you have a clear idea of what to do step by step you will not get stuck while project building.
