# web


I am not new to web dev I just build a project(shopping cart) in node.js in my vacation time. So it is an easy task for me most of the code was given in the task folder I just create a  function and called it by OnClick function. I used a switch case to perform sound according to the letter key. first, I used the number as an argument in the switch case then I passed the letter as an argument, which make the code more optimised  Then I simply changed the style by making changes in the CSS file.
