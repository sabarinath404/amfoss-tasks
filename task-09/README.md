web-scraping is an interesting task but Rust language is not that easy. most of the code was given on the task page the only task is to write into  CSV file. first, I tried to write directly into CSV but it didn't work so I wrote it into a  vec(array)  then in a for loop each data was written into CSV by accessing the index.
